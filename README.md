Create an SVG logo using prompts in the terminal!

## Description
Everyone needs a brand. The easiest way to build a brand is with a logo. With this app, you will be given a list of prompts inside the terminal. The prompts will include questions such as 'Enter text (Max Characters : 3)', 'What color would you like to set the text? (Enter keyword or hex value)', 'Select A Shape', and 'What color would you the shape to be? (Enter keyword or hex value'). After entering an answer for each of these prompts, you will have generated a brand new logo based off of your input. 

To get started, open the integrated terminal and type in node.index.js. From here the prompts will appear one at a time. Upon completion, a logo.svg file will be created with your new logo inside of that. Following this, you are also able to run tests to make sure that your input has matched the output of your logo. To run this, type npm test in your terminal. It will then run each test inside the test.js folder and give you either a Pass or Fail error.
